    `shell`
Decoding COVID-19: India's Case Study" is a comprehensive analysis project that utilizes multiple datasets. It explores age-wise distribution, confirmed cases, recoveries, and daily decreases. Additionally, it examines state-wise data on cases, death and recovery status, available hospital beds, testing data, and population distribution. By uncovering insights from these datasets, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 situation in India, enabling informed decision-making and effective strategies to combat the pandemic.

# Module 1: Cleaning the dataset
Data Pre-processing is one of the important steps in data analytics because data that is not processed can lead to different unwanted results when the data will be used for further applications. This task includes sub-tasks such as handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, datatype transformation, removing duplicates, etc

# Module 2: Analysing data using SQL  (task 1-task 15)
Perform data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducting Data Analysis using SQL. You will generate queries for given problem statements. 

# Module 3: Analysing data using SQL (task 16-task 21)
Perform data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducting Data Analysis using SQL. You will generate queries for given problem statements.
